Link-AI
=======

All speech simple modular AI. Perfect for experimenting with JavaScript and PHP

You should use https, to prevent the constant authorization prompt from the browser. You can also disable the speech recognition, in the global.js file (set speechRecognitionSupport to false).

Also, at this point, only a decent computer with the latest version of Chrome will work.
